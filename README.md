Use your index finger like a magic pen! This computer vision project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect your hand and allows you to draw in the air — the drawing appears directly on your screen in real time.
# Invisible Pen with Hand Gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project allows you to draw in the air using your index finger and erase the canvas by showing your full palm. It uses real-time hand tracking powered by Google MediaPipe and OpenCV in Python. Ideal for learning about gesture recognition, computer vision, and human-computer interaction.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time hand detection with MediaPipe
- Air drawing using only index finger
- Gesture-based erasing (show full palm)
- Adjustable canvas and drawing color

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
